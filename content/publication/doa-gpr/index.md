abstract: "In this paper, we employ a Gaussian Process Regression method based on the Polynomial Root Finding technique (PRF-GPR) to address the Direction of arrival (DoA) problem. Arrays whose electromagnetic coupling is taken into account in an exact way are employed in our DoA studies here. The Search-free DoA estimation algorithm is modified to accommodate the exact coupling with this learning-based method, PRF-GPR, which is capable of estimating DoA when multiple signals arrive at a receiver array with unknown electromagnetic coupling in its elements. Simulations are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method."
